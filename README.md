# Machine Learning for Public Health

This workshop intends to help you get your feet wet with machine learning
on a public health related problem. By no means will this workshop make you
a machine learning expert -- you'll definitely walk out here with deep holes
in your knowledge of machine learning. However, the hope is that you get enough
bits of information that you can fill in the gaps as you continue to learn in
the future.

Machine learning is a powerful tool, and public health is a sector rich with
data and problems to apply machine learning to. Maybe you can take what you
learn here as a starting point to making waves in the world of public health.

We recommend one of two ways to setup. If you are on OS X / Linux and have
virtualenv pre-installed, you can run locally by running the `setup` script
in this directory. Then you can use the `start_jupyterlab` script to start
a Jupyterlab server to work with.

Otherwise, we recommend using [Binder](https://mybinder.org/).
